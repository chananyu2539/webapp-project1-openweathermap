Project: Google Weather Maps

overview:
    we want to convey the current weather and temperature from around the world to user in real-time-process

APIs:
    OpenWeather:
        - Request for data from openweather with "JSON" as returning format object
   
    Google Maps:
        - googlemap's places: using in search box for user to search in google map
        - get bounds: get boundary of the searched region
        - infowindow: show temp. and weather of target area
        - getBound + NorthEast + SouthWest: get the region of the current map view, in latitude and longtitude
        - geoJSON: after converting the JSON object from openweather to geoJSON, used this for marking weather on google map 

Known bugs:
    Fixed:
        - Inconsistency in openweather api: the format of JSON is not consistent. (sometimes it "lat,lng", sometimes it "Lat,Lng")
    Not fixed:
        - When you zoom in too much, the return type is [] and cause error. I just prevent it from complaining by just try-catch.
        - Sometimes, it skipped the city in the region, resulted in no report on that city
